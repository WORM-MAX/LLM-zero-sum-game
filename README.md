# Can Large Language Model Agents Utilize Game History to Employ the Minimax Strategy?

This is my course paper of Game Theory. 

In this article, I have analyzed the relationship between 100 actions and game history records of GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. The idea is inspired by paper "Professionals play minimax" which collected soccer penalty kick data.

In this repo, one part is direct answer action; another is thought + action.

## Conclusion
LLMs' "intuitive" result bad in the long run. Data file analysis and python is needed.
